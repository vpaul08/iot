# Arduino Heart Decor
This project uses Arduino UNO microprocessor with relays and IR sensor. Here you will see how to use the `EEPROM` registers to store something permanently in the device and read the stored values as well in order to trigger certain actions.

This project was done as part of the instructables (https://www.instructables.com/) project. The detailed instructions to build the project can be found here: https://www.instructables.com/Heart-Shaped-Remote-Controlled-Back-lit-Wall-Decor/
