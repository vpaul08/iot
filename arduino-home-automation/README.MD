# Arduino Home Automation
This project uses Arduino UNO microprocessor with relays and contactors (for heavy load) to automate turning on/off of devices based on time of the day.

This project demonstrates how to make the best use of millis instead of delays to trigger actions asynchronously.

It also demonstrates the use of IR remote for responding to signals received from the remote to control the the electric switches.

It uses RTC library for keeping track of time to perform timely actions.
